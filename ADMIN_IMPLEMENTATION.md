# Admin Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented complete admin functionality with database integration for the ShopOMG e-commerce application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Entity Classes Created
- **Category** - Product categories management
- **Product** - Product information with category relationship
- **ProductImage** - Multiple images per product
- **ProductReview** - Customer reviews for products
- **Cart** - Shopping cart items
- **Order** - Customer orders
- **OrderDetail** - Order line items
- **Report** - Revenue reporting data

### 2. Repositories Created
All JPA repositories with custom query methods:
- CategoryRepository
- ProductRepository (with search by name and category)
- ProductImageRepository
- ProductReviewRepository
- CartRepository
- OrderRepository (with date range and status filtering)
- OrderDetailRepository
- ReportRepository

### 3. DTOs Created
Data Transfer Objects for clean API responses:
- CategoryDTO
- ProductDTO
- OrderDTO
- AccountDTO
- RevenueDTO
- VIPCustomerDTO

### 4. Services Created
Business logic layer:
- **CategoryService** - CRUD operations for categories
- **ProductService** - Product management with search
- **OrderService** - Order management and status updates
- **AdminAccountService** - User account management
- **RevenueService** - Revenue calculations and VIP customer identification

### 5. Admin Controller
Single controller (`AdminController`) with all admin endpoints:

#### Category Endpoints
- `GET /admin/api/categories` - List all categories
- `GET /admin/api/categories/{id}` - Get category by ID
- `POST /admin/api/categories` - Create category
- `PUT /admin/api/categories/{id}` - Update category
- `DELETE /admin/api/categories/{id}` - Delete category

#### Product Endpoints
- `GET /admin/api/products?keyword=` - List/search products
- `GET /admin/api/products/{id}` - Get product by ID
- `POST /admin/api/products` - Create product
- `PUT /admin/api/products/{id}` - Update product
- `DELETE /admin/api/products/{id}` - Delete product

#### Order Endpoints
- `GET /admin/api/orders?status=` - List orders with optional status filter

### 6. Updated HTML Pages
All admin pages now use real API calls instead of localStorage:

#### Category Page (`/admin/category`)
- List all categories from database
- Create new categories
- Edit existing categories
- Delete categories
- Real-time updates

#### Product Page (`/admin/product`)
- List all products with search
- Create products with category selection
- Edit products
- Delete products
- Category dropdown populated from database

#### Order Page (`/admin/order`)
- List orders with status filter
- Update order status (PENDING, SHIPPING, COMPLETED, CANCELED)
- Display customer information
- Format dates and currency

#### Account Page (`/admin/account`)
- List accounts with search and role filter
- Edit account information
- Update user roles (ADMIN/USER)
- Delete accounts

#### Revenue Page (`/admin/revenue`)
- Calculate revenue by date range
- Display total revenue and order count
- List completed orders
- Auto-load on page open

#### VIP Page (`/admin/vip`)
- Calculate VIP customers by spending threshold
- Display customers sorted by total spending
- Configurable threshold (default: 1,000,000 VND)

### 7. Security Configuration
- Enabled `@EnableMethodSecurity` for method-level security
- All admin routes require ADMIN role
- API endpoints protected with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`

### 8. Database Integration
All operations interact with SQL Server database:
- Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Transaction management with `@Transactional`
- Proper entity relationships (ManyToOne, OneToMany)
- Date/time handling with LocalDateTime
- BigDecimal for currency values

## Key Features

### Real-time Database Operations
- All CRUD operations immediately reflect in database
- No localStorage or mock data
- Proper error handling

### Search and Filtering
- Product search by name
- Order filtering by status
- Account filtering by role and keyword
- Revenue filtering by date range

### Data Validation

- Proper data types (BigDecimal for money)
- Entity relationships maintained

### User Experience
- Async/await for smooth operations
- Bootstrap modals for forms
- Confirmation dialogs for deletions
- Vietnamese currency formatting
- Date/time formatting
